## General info
This project is a simple JavaScript fader for a virtual mixer table.
The main aim of this project was to build something using the
very basics of HTML/ CSS/ and of course vanilla JS.
One step further for mastering the DOM!
This fader allows you to output the desired audio level, from -80db to 10db.
Enjoy it! ;)
